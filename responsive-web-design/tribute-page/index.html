        <p>Believe it or not, there is plenty of good quality, FREE artwork for you to use when you are creating web pages, brochures, or anything else. Some of the free artwork is still licensed, but some is in what's known as the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a>. Anything in the public domain is free for anyone to use, for any purpose, without having to worry about giving credit to a copyright owner or including another license statement or anything like that.</p>
        <p>For example, the image above is a public domain image available from <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>. <span class="warning">As always, though, you should check the licensing of any image you intend to use.</span></p>
